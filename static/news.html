        <blockquote>
            <p>Matthew Craig, a fourth-year computer science and economics student who has declared the minor, said he is interested in the minor to acquire useful skills for potential jobs in the field. He said the pathway has so far focused on machine learning and deep learning.</p>
            <p>"I'm glad to see the embrace of data science (by the UCLA engineering department) and the embrace of... the practical skills in the courses that are included in the minor," Craig said.</p>
            <p>He said he recommends the minor for any student interested in data science, computation or software engineering as a whole.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Bishop Montgomery seniors <b>Matthew Craig '19</b> and Gerrick Cardenas '19 have recorded perfect scores on their SAT and ACT exams, respectively. Craig took the exam in December 2017 and learned shortly after that he had achieved what only .03% of test takers had&ndash; a perfect 1600. Craig also earned a perfect 800 on his SAT II Math exam in June and was recently named a National Merit Semi-Finalist.</p>
            ...
            <p>In addition to being an outstanding student, Craig is involved in many extra-curricular activities throughout the South Bay. He is a founding member and president of Bishop's Technology and Programming Club, a varsity cross country runner, a community member of Redondo Union High School's First Robotics Competition Team, and, as of June 28, an Eagle Scout. Craig earned the scout rank by designing and constructing a gaga ball pit at St. Lawrence Martyr School, his alma mater. "Gaga ball is like dodge ball,"" explains Craig, "but players can only strike below the knees... It's a gentler version of dodge ball and perfect for kids of any age, especially little ones."</p>

            <p>For the fourth year in a row, middle schoolers from St. Lawrence Martyr Catholic School have captured the Academic Junior High Decathlon title at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.</p>
            <p>"It is very loud when you go in there," said Craig. "Even though I knew what to expect, I was still a little nervous, but not as nervous as I was the first time I went to the regional competition."</p>
            <p>Craig, his 15 teammates and five alternates continue to study as they prepare to move on to state competition in Sacramento April 18.</p>

            <p>To participate on the team, high achieving students must try out, receive teacher recommendations and be strong in a particular subject area where the team needs to fill roles.</p>
            <p>"It might not be the smartest person that makes it on the team, but it has to be someone who can work well with everyone on the team and who is willing to work at it," Craig said.</p>
