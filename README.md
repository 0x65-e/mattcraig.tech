# About

This website is written for Cloudflare Workers using Rust and the [workers-rs](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-rs) crate. Cloudflare workers is a serverless, "function as a service" (FaaS) platform that runs across distributed data centers.

It serves static files stored in Workers KV, a serverless key-value store on the edge.

## Usage

With `wrangler` CLI, you can build, test, and deploy to Workers with the following commands: 

```bash
# compiles project to WebAssembly and will warn of any issues
wrangler build 

# runs Worker in an ideal development workflow (with a local server, file watcher & more)
wrangler dev

# deploys Worker globally to Cloudflare
wrangler publish
```
